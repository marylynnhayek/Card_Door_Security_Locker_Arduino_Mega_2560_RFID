# Card_Door_Security_Locker_Arduino_Mega_2560_RFID
Developed an automatic door locker, using the Arduino mega 2560 with an RFID kit. Using Arduino IDE as a compiler to implement the code on the real hardware, and Fritzing for the simulation. Many options have been added, for example: 1- If the user has up to 3 failed attempts to unlock the door, the whole system will lock and only the admin will be able to unlock the door with his own card, etc. The important step was to learn how to read and manipulate the Arduino EEPROM by storing the UIDs in it, and programming it to fulfill the project's purpose.  This rep includes the final code, along with the powerpoint presentation which includes the following points:  1- Project Mission (The technical environment || L'environnement technique)  2- Hardware Presentation a- Bloc diagram ( Schéma-bloc du système ) b- Complete electrical diagram ( Schéma électrique complet ) c- Tools used d- Pins connections  3- Software Presentation a- Software Flowchart  4- Future expansion (Améliorations possibles)
